# Pico USB Audio + LED Activity

A project that turns your Raspberry Pi Pico 2 into a **USB audio device (speaker)** using the TinyUSB library. It also lights up an LED on GPIO2 whenever audio data is received, providing visual feedback for audio activity.

> Goal: Make your Raspberry Pi Pico 2 act as a **USB speaker** when connected to a computer and blink an LED with audio activity.
